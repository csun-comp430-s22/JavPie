## Type Checking, or in python, Type Hinting,
## can only be run in python, and our language being created
## will not be able to support it.
##

##
## And without making this code compatible
## or witout the use for external tools
## which are not included in this project,
## there will be no tests regarding type hinting.
## This also applies for Code Coverage for the typechecker
##

##
## This will also be explained in the presentation video
## and in documentation
